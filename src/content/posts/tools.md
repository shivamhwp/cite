so the thing is i'm very fond of trying different stuff, take anything if it's cinema, music, food etc. so it also comes to tools i work with daily. so here are some of the tools i'm using currently.<br/>

### non-dev tools

<ul class="pb-3 flex flex-col list-decimal pl-6 sm:pl-0">
<li class="pt-2">machine : macbook air m1 2020 : solid. these machines are wild. now the latest one comes with 16gb ram. best option if you don wanna game.</li>
<li>browser :  <a target="_blank" href="https://helium.computer/" class="text-accent-foreground/85 rounded-xs underline underline-offset-2 decoration-0">helium</a>. wukko is making this. think of it as thin chromium with extra security features. really good on memory too. really beautiful too. drm shi doesn't work. safari or zen sometimes for that.</li>
<li>note-taking : <a target="_blank" href="https://www.notion.so/" class="text-accent-foreground/85 rounded-xs underline underline-offset-2 decoration-0">notion</a> & <a href="https://notesnook.com" class="text-accent-foreground/85 rounded-xs underline underline-offset-2 decoration-0" target="_blank">notesnook</a>. notion, best for management of any kind. really nothing comes close to the amount of vastness. notesnook for personal use, end to end encrypted notes.</li>
<li>tracker block : <a href="https://nextdns.io/" class="text-accent-foreground/85 rounded-xs underline underline-offset-2 decoration-0">nextdns</a>. really nice to block shi trackers and block sites etc. </li>
</ul>

### dev tools

<ul class="flex flex-col list-decimal pl-6 sm:pl-0">
<li class="pt-2">editor : <a href="https://cursor.com" target="_blank" class="text-accent-foreground/85 rounded-xs underline underline-offset-2 decoration-0">cursor</a>,<a href="https://zed.dev" target="_blank" class="text-accent-foreground/85 rounded-xs underline underline-offset-2 decoration-0"> (zed+ <a href="https://opencode.ai" class="text-accent-foreground/85 rounded-xs underline underline-offset-2 decoration-0" target="_blank" >opencode</a>)</a> & <a href="https://helix-editor.com/" target="_blank" class="text-accent-foreground/85 rounded-xs underline underline-offset-2 decoration-0">helix</a><a href="https://astronvim.com/" target="_blank" class="text-accent-foreground/85 rounded-xs underline underline-offset-2 decoration-0">/nvim</a>(rarely). cursor because dx is best among others. zed is really really fast. with opencode it's pretty good. helix as replacement for nvim. just trying it out. kinda edit a lil doc or something with it.
</li>

<li>terminal :  <a href="https://ghostty.org/" target="_blank" class="text-accent-foreground/85 rounded-xs underline underline-offset-2 decoration-0">ghostty</a>. have gone from iterm2 to alacritty to wezterm to default mac one. but after mitchell hashimoto released ghostty, i've been stuck with it. really nice,stable and pretty fking fast.</li>

<li>shell: <a href="https://fishshell.com/" target="_blank" class="text-accent-foreground/85 rounded-xs underline underline-offset-2 decoration-0">fish</a>. have tried other like zsh(oh-my-zsh, powerlevel10k, starship), bash etc. but fish is the fastest and pretty nice to use.</li>
<li>cli agent : <a href="https://claude.com/product/claude-code" target="_blank">claude code</a>(not fond of using it). <a href="https://opencode.ai" target="_blank">opencode.</a></li>
</ul>

this list keeps updating.
cya soon :)
