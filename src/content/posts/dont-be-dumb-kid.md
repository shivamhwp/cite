a person can never be fully bad or fully good. everyone is intermingled.

a person can surely be a psycopath,narcissist,manipulative and a fkign piece of shit. does that make them bad as a person. not their actions that can be totally bad or totally good in some cases. but the essense of them, their character. i don't know.

ignore and avoid the rent-seekers, fk off the ill-intentioners.
    
help (in your capacity.). but first help yourself. you can't help someone else if you're fked. one thing i've learned till now is there is no better feeling than helping another person genuinely. not to get something from them in return. but, because you want to.

don't pretend, you're hurting yourself. be who you are. you may not know right now. but don't latch on to identities. wait, wait a little. you'll know soon. 

avoid groupthink, not group but groupthink. make sure your thinking is individual.


ps : i might update it in the future.
