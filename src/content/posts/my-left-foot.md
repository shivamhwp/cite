my left foot. if you can call a thing beautifful this is it. and if you can call someone an artist that is daniel day lewis. <br/>

i would also like to mention the performance of hugh o'connor as the "child christy brown". holy fking hell, that was a crazy great performance from both actors.
<br/>
and the pain you see in the scene where christy(daniel) gets to know about eileen's relationship. omfg, the amount of pain that scene expresses. like how the camera goes around the table rather than being on christy, coz the pain is too much for him.
<br/>
everytime i see daniel day lewis act, the respect for the dedication of art given by this person to his work in my eyes reaches new levels. like it's truly so mesmerising to see this level of acting. <br/>
also the story in itself is so powerful as christy brown literally did paintings and typed with this left foot. like this is mental.
<br/>
not much to say now. if something comes up in my head. will add it here.
<br/>
cya.
