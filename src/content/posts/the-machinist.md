<div class="bg-white/70 text-black px-1"> now i'm just thinking and discussing with myself (contains spoilers)</div>
<p class="blur-sm hover:blur-none transition duration-500">
first thing i noticed in the movie was a greenish tint in all the movie, which tries to give the whole movie a colorless vibe. only things that have color are the things from <b>trevor's</b>  memory eg. the red car, with which he hit's <b>maria's</b> kid, <b>nicholas</b>. he hasn't slept in an year.

<p>--- more soon ---</p>
