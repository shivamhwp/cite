last night, i watched the machinist. not gonna lie, the soundtracks by <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Roque+Ba%C3%B1os" target="_blank" class="text-black">Roque Ba√±os<a/> gave the movie very horrifying feel. i loved the movie.

first thing i noticed in the movie was a greenish tint in all the movie, which tries to give the whole movie a colorless vibe. only things that have color are the things from <b>trevor's</b>  memory eg. the red car, with which he hit's <b>maria's</b> kid, <b>nicholas</b>.
