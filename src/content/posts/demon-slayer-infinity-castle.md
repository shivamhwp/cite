straight from outside the cinema hall.<br>
hmm, what do i think about this ?
masterpiece.<br>
although the story being a good guy-bad guy story. the way it is presented gives it pretty major edge.
the animation is bonkers. no like seriously, stuff looks pretty bonkers. when you see it. i can think of few things that make this movie great.

<ul class="pb-3 list-decimal">
<li>of course, animation.</li>
<li>the akaza backstory makes it prety emotional and the reason why he's doing stuff. like you begin to develop sympathy for the person who killed rengoku.</li>
<blockquote>based on how much story they covered in this movie. it seems really hard they will able to complete the adaptatoin of the manga. lesse what they cut.
like there we two fights one with akaza and with the other (icy) somehting guy and that was not even complete. so it seems very hard. 
</blockquote>
<li>music. although the volume at the cinema was lil loud. but it's pretty fking good. it really blends in with the action you see.</li>
<li>the one last thing that impressed me was that they were kinda accurate in explaining the muzan's power and the scale of infinity castle. giyu's and tanjiro's fight with akaza gives you a pretty good estimate of what's to come.
<blockquote>
i've read the manga, so based on that it seems pretty accurate. 
</blockquote>
</li>

</ul>

so overall it's a fking good movie. kinda must watch.<br>
ps: i might update this blog if something comes to mind.
cya
