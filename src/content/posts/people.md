there are few people that i admire, their story fascinates me, their art or their work fascinates me. i don't always like think about them. but there is a fascination in as much as i have read about them or known them, more like appreciation to their work.
just so you know (this is not a ranked list. just like putting it there).

- my parents
- shwetabh gangwar
- theo
- prime
- kanye
- j krishnamurti
- varun mayya

..... i don't seem to remember anyone else. i had a lot in mind, but like i don't seem to remember them.

oh also, i really love films. i don't think they're for timepass. i think they are very great art form. films(+ anime) can change you, or more accurately put, your perspective.
there is no need for all of them to be this deep, introspecitve shi. they can be fun too. but there is something very very interesting thing to it.
i mean at the end stories are actually insane. i think film enhances it.
it can show you different aspects or you might see it from a wholly new angle.

ps: i'll be addding a lot to this blog in future.

cya.
