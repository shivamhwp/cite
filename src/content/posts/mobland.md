well, first of all, tom hardy is a fking g. <br/>
now secondly this show is pretty good watch in my opinion. i think you should definitively give it a watch. Guy Ritche has done and amazing job here. the episodes don't bore you. the twists are great and the characters are written pretty good. like you can see yourself hating a particular character and loving or feeling loyal to another one. <br/>
and holy fk tom hardy's acting is pretty insane. 
it also mirrors the same power structure as we see in the <a href='https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0361748/' className='text-red-500' >inglorious bastards by quentin tarantino </a>. as for display we have a face who's in power. but you know power is in the shadows (i'm batman).<br/>
the other characters also held up pretty tight. they got their own weight in the show and that's very well put i think. rarely it happens.<br/>
the best thing that has been done here is how the suspense and tension has been distributed through all the episodes.
i am excited for the second season and where the story goes now. i'll write about that too.<br/>
till then.
